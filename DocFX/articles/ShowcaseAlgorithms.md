# Showcase Algorithms

TuringTrader comes with several showcase algorithms. These are meant to serve as more complete real-life examples for implementing strategies with TuringTrader. We believe these strategies to be great assets for learning, as well as useful starting points for your experiments.

We implement these strategies as close to the original publication as possible. Sometimes it is not clear how exactly the authors simulated these strategies for their publication. The data sources used, and the methods of extending/ substituting them to reach further into the past are of particular concern here. Due to these circumstances, our implementations might show results significantly different from those published. Often some simple changes to the data sources, the code, and the parameters can substantially improve the performance of these strategies.

Here are the strategies we implemented, in no particular order:
