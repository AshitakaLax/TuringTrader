# Demo 07: Algorithm Subclassing

unfortunately, we didn't write this article yet. However, the demo code exists [here](https://bitbucket.org/fbertram/fub_tradingsimulator/src/develop/Algorithms/Demo%20Algorithms/Demo07_Subclassing.cs). The main concept is, that an algorithm can be sub-classed and serve as a data source for another algorithm.
